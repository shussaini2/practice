    We present a curated database of the best campsites in the
    vast woods and backcountry of the World Wide Web Wilderness.
    We increase access to adventure for the public while
    promoting safe and respectful use of resources. The expert
    wilderness trekkers on our staff personally verify each
    campsite to make sure that they are up to our standards. We
    also present a platform for campers to share reviews on
    campsites they have visited with each other.

I will not follow where the path may lead, but I will go where there is no path, and I will leave a trail.
